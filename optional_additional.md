Work with the pyramid program from the methods.md file, except now we want it to make a real-deal double-sided pyramid!

If we call the program like this: `ruby pyramid.rb 23`
It should print out a pyramid 23 rows tall.

1) If the number is a multiple of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number.
2) If the number is a multiple of 5 print "Buzz" instead of the number.
3) For the numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 100, however:

1) If the number is a multiple of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number.
2) If the number is a multiple of 5 print "Buzz" instead of the number.
3) For the numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

Remember, break the problem up in to manageable chunks. Upon reading, you should see “Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 100” and stop, because you already have enough information to write code and make that happen. Delete that part of the question from your attention span and continue reading until you reach another point where you have enough information to write code. Continue this process until you’ve solved the entire problem. You can do it!
